pyautogui
=========

A cross-platform GUI automation Python module for human beings. Used to programmatically control the mouse &amp; keyboard.

THIS MODULE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT NOT YET IN A USEABLE STATE.

This module seeks to replace PyUserInput, PyKeyboard, PyMouse, pykey, and pyhook. See the roadmap in the documentation.

NOTE - It is a known issue that the keyboard-related functions don't work on Ubuntu VMs in Virtualbox.
